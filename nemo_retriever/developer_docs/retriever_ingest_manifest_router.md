# Retriever Ingest Manifest Router

Status: architecture note

This note describes a proposed follow-up architecture for `retriever ingest`
that handles unknown folders and mixed file types without eagerly constructing
or initializing every possible modality pipeline.

The immediate release bridge in PR 2068 protects the PDF-only fast path by
inspecting the observed input extensions and routing homogeneous inputs to a
specific extraction path. That is the right release-safe fix, but it is not the
final architecture for mixed folders. The long-term design should plan over a
file manifest, build only the branches needed by the actual input set, and
merge normalized extracted rows before the common embed/store stages.

## Context

`retriever ingest` is moving from PDF-only ingestion toward "everything pipeline
supports" ingestion. That includes:

- PDF and document inputs: PDF, DOCX, PPTX
- Text-like inputs: TXT, HTML
- Images: JPG, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, TIF, BMP, SVG
- Media: MP3, WAV, M4A, MP4, MOV, MKV

The desired user experience is simple:

```bash
retriever ingest /path/to/data --run-mode batch
```

Users should not need to know the modality mix in a folder ahead of time. At the
same time, the system should not eagerly import optional media libraries, check
audio/video dependencies, download model weights, or create actors for file
types that are not present.

PR 2068 is a bridge for this release window. It keeps `auto` convenient for
users while preserving the dedicated PDF/document graph when the input set is
PDF/DOC/PPTX-only. That avoids routing existing PDF-only workloads through the
generic mixed-input operator.

## Core Problem

The current mixed-input fallback relies on `MultiTypeExtractOperator`. This
operator is a composite actor: it receives a batch, groups rows by extension,
and then runs PDF, image, text, HTML, audio, or video sub-pipelines inside its
own `process()` method.

That shape is convenient, but it has several scaling and maintenance problems:

- It hides natural pipeline stages from Ray Data. Ray sees one broad multitype
  map stage instead of separate PDF extraction, page-elements, OCR, table,
  image, audio, video, and text stages.
- Stage-specific scheduling is harder. The dedicated PDF graph can tune PDF
  extraction tasks, page-element actors, OCR actors, table actors, and embedding
  actors independently. A composite multitype actor collapses those boundaries.
- Actor and model reuse can suffer when heavy sub-operators are constructed
  inside multitype processing instead of having their own persistent actor pool.
- Missing optional dependencies can be discovered late and in branches that
  should not matter for the actual input set.
- Extraction wiring is duplicated between the dedicated graph paths and
  `MultiTypeExtractOperator`, increasing drift risk as modality graphs evolve.
- Operational visibility is worse. Ray dashboards and logs show a broad
  multitype stage instead of pinpointing which modality stage is slow.

The measured PDF-only regression that motivated the PR 2068 bridge is an
example of this architectural issue. When PDF-only inputs were routed through
the generic `auto` path, wall time regressed by 2.6x on `jp20` and 4.4x on
`bo767` in a self-hosted-NIM batch test, while quality and NIM call counts
stayed comparable. That points to graph structure and operator scheduling, not
model inference.

## Desired Properties

The long-term design should satisfy these properties:

- Unknown folders work without user-provided modality knowledge.
- Only observed modalities are built and validated.
- PDF-only and document-only inputs use the dedicated PDF/document graph.
- Homogeneous non-PDF inputs use a specific graph, not a generic composite path.
- Mixed folders fan out to modality-specific branches and then fan in to common
  post-extraction stages.
- Branches reuse the same operator-building helpers as dedicated graphs.
- Optional dependencies are branch-scoped:
  - no audio/video files means no `ffmpeg` or ASR requirement
  - no SVG files means no `cairosvg` requirement
  - no local OCR/page-element work means no local GPU model initialization
- Batch and in-process modes preserve consistent semantics.
- The common downstream contract remains unchanged for embedding and VDB upload.

## Proposed Architecture

Introduce an input manifest and extraction branch plan.

### InputManifest

The manifest is built before graph construction. It should be cheap and avoid
importing heavy model or media libraries.

Suggested fields:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class InputManifest:
    files_by_family: dict[str, tuple[str, ...]]
    unsupported_files: tuple[str, ...]
    explicit_globs: tuple[str, ...]
    has_buffers: bool
```

Families should match the ingest input families:

```text
pdf, doc, image, txt, html, audio, video
```

The manifest should preserve enough information to answer:

- Which branches are needed?
- Which explicit user constraints should be validated?
- Which optional dependencies should be checked?
- Which source files should each branch receive?

### ExtractionBranchPlan

The planner converts the manifest and user config into branch plans:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ExtractionBranchPlan:
    family: str
    input_paths: tuple[str, ...]
    graph_kind: str
    params: object
    required_capabilities: frozenset[str]
```

Example branches:

| Family | Branch graph |
| --- | --- |
| `pdf`, `doc` | document conversion, PDF split, PDF extraction, page-elements, table/graphic, OCR, optional chunk |
| `image` | image load, page-elements, table/graphic, OCR, optional chunk |
| `txt` | text split/chunk |
| `html` | HTML split/chunk |
| `audio` | media chunk, ASR, optional chunk |
| `video` | video split, optional ASR, frame OCR, dedup/fusion, optional chunk |

## Branch Execution

For `run_mode=batch`, the executor can execute each branch as a Ray Dataset
pipeline over only that branch's files, then union the branch datasets after
schema normalization.

Conceptually:

```text
manifest
  -> plan branches
  -> for each present branch:
       read branch files
       apply branch extraction graph
       normalize extracted rows
  -> union extracted rows
  -> apply common post-extract graph
       dedup/caption/content reshape/embed/vdb/webhook
```

For `run_mode=inprocess`, the same branch plan can execute branch graphs on
pandas DataFrames, concatenate normalized outputs, and then apply the common
post-extract graph.

This does not require the core `Graph` object to become a fully general DAG on
day one. The branch plan can sit above the existing linear executor. That keeps
the change focused while still delivering fan-out/fan-in behavior.

## Avoiding Duplicate Graph Code

The goal is not to create separate hand-written graph builders that drift.
Instead, extract shared helpers from the current `build_graph()`:

```text
append_pdf_document_extraction(graph, params, split_config)
append_page_image_detection(graph, extract_params)
append_image_extraction(graph, params, split_config)
append_text_extraction(graph, text_params)
append_html_extraction(graph, html_params)
append_audio_extraction(graph, audio_params, asr_params, split_config)
append_video_extraction(graph, video_params, asr_params, extract_params, split_config)
append_common_post_extract_stages(graph, stage_order, embed/store/webhook params)
```

The current dedicated PDF path and the future PDF branch should call the same
PDF helper. The current image path and future image branch should call the same
image helper. `MultiTypeExtractOperator` should stop reimplementing those
subgraphs internally.

If the branch plan is adopted, `build_graph()` can remain as the entry point but
delegate to helpers based on the plan. The public API does not need a new graph
construction surface.

## Dependency Handling

Dependency checks should move from broad graph construction to branch
validation:

| Dependency | Required when |
| --- | --- |
| `cairosvg` | at least one SVG file is routed to the image branch |
| `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` binaries | at least one audio or video file is routed to media branches |
| local page-elements model | PDF/image/video-frame OCR branches require local page-elements with no remote endpoint |
| local OCR model | OCR is enabled and no OCR endpoint is configured |
| local ASR model | audio/video ASR is enabled and no remote ASR endpoint is configured |

This keeps absent modalities invisible to the runtime. A PDF-only folder should
not validate media dependencies. A JPG-only folder should not validate SVG
rendering. An audio-free mixed folder should not initialize ASR.

## Impact on Current Architecture

The graph representation is already flexible enough to describe more than a
linear chain, but the current batch and in-process executors linearize graphs
and reject fan-out. A branch planner avoids requiring a full executor rewrite.

Likely changes:

- Add `InputManifest` and `ExtractionBranchPlan` near the ingest planning code.
- Replace scalar input-family resolution with manifest-to-branch planning.
- Refactor `build_graph()` into shared append helpers while preserving it as the
  main entry point.
- Add executor helpers that can apply a graph to an existing Ray Dataset without
  immediately materializing to pandas.
- Add a branch union step that validates and normalizes schemas before common
  stages.
- Keep explicit `--input-type` as a validation/filtering hint, not the primary
  architecture.
- Keep typed shortcuts such as `extract_audio()` and `extract_video()` as forced
  branch selection APIs.

## Migration Plan

1. Keep the PR 2068 release bridge in place for the release window, including
   aligned multitype media defaults.
2. Extract reusable graph-building helpers from the dedicated PDF, image, text,
   HTML, audio, and video paths.
3. Add `InputManifest` generation and tests for directory, glob, explicit file,
   and buffer inputs.
4. Add a branch planner that emits a single branch for homogeneous inputs and
   multiple branches for mixed inputs.
5. Add batch branch execution and union before common stages.
6. Add in-process branch execution with matching semantics.
7. Route mixed `auto` through the branch planner instead of
   `MultiTypeExtractOperator`.
8. Keep `MultiTypeExtractOperator` as a compatibility fallback until branch
   execution has parity tests.
9. Remove duplicated subgraph logic from `MultiTypeExtractOperator` or retire the
   operator once no public path depends on it.

## Test Plan

Recommended coverage:

- PDF-only directory uses the dedicated PDF graph.
- DOCX/PPTX-only directory uses the PDF/document graph.
- Image-only directory uses image graph and does not build audio/video branches.
- SVG-only image directory requires `cairosvg`; JPG-only image directory does
  not.
- Audio/video-free mixed directory does not validate `ffmpeg`.
- Audio and video directories report missing `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` before actor
  startup.
- Mixed PDF/image/text/html folder produces the same normalized rows as running
  each modality separately and concatenating results.
- Common embed and VDB upload run once after branch union.
- Batch and in-process paths produce comparable source counts and metadata.
- Stage-level Ray execution plans expose modality stages rather than one
  monolithic multitype extraction stage.

## Open Questions

- Should branch execution run branches sequentially or launch independent Ray
  pipelines before union? Sequential branch execution is simpler; parallel branch
  execution may improve throughput for large mixed datasets.
- Should explicit globs be expanded before manifest planning, or should
  unresolved globs force the compatibility path?
- How should branch-level failures be reported when only one modality fails in a
  mixed ingest?
- What is the minimum normalized schema before union?
- Should audio and video ASR share one ASR actor pool when both branches are
  present?
- Should the public CLI expose a "strict modalities" option that fails if the
  manifest contains any unplanned family?

## Recommendation

Do not expand `MultiTypeExtractOperator` into a larger all-purpose router. Use
it only as a release bridge and compatibility fallback.

The core system should become multi-file and mixed-modality aware through input
manifest planning. That gives users the simple "ingest this folder" experience
without making absent modalities impose dependency, model, memory, or scheduling
costs.
