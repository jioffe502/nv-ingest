"""Regression tests pinning the ``image_caption`` stage's concurrency.

Customer-reported head-of-line block (26.08.1):

    Client A ingests a small text-only PDF (``--task=extract:{...}``,
    no caption work).  On its own A finishes in ~0.45 s.

    Client B concurrently ingests a larger PDF with the full caption
    pipeline enabled (``--task=extract:{...} --task=caption:{}``).
    B takes ~110 s, dominated by caption work.

    When B is already in flight, A's wall-clock stretches from
    ~0.45 s to ~59 s, and the CLI trace shows the entirety of the
    extra time accruing in ``image_caption_channel_in`` — i.e. A is
    sitting in the ``image_caption`` stage's input queue waiting for
    the *single* stage replica to finish B's images, even though A
    has zero caption work to do.

Root cause:

    Both ``config/default_pipeline.yaml`` and
    ``config/custom_summarization_pipeline.yaml`` declared

        replicas:
          static_replicas: { value: 1 }
          max_replicas:    { value: 1 }

    on the ``image_caption`` stage.  Every item flows through every
    stage in the Ray-actor pipeline (stages no-op items whose task
    list does not include their task, but they still have to dequeue
    them serially), so a single replica serializes A behind B.

Fix:

    Both YAMLs now declare multiple replicas — mirroring the
    ``text_embedder`` stage, which is architecturally similar (remote
    HTTP-only call to a NIM endpoint).  This test pins minimum
    invariants on the per-stage replica configuration so a future
    edit can not silently revert to the single-replica configuration
    that caused the customer-visible regression.

The actual end-to-end "A finishes in << B" benchmark requires a
running nv-ingest + VLM service and is out of scope for unit tests;
the configuration invariants checked here are the static surface
that the bug fix relies on.
