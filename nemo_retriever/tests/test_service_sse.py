"""J4 — per-job SSE routing — HTTP-surface tests.

We assert the route shape and error responses for
``GET /v1/ingest/job/{job_id}/events``:

* unknown job → ``404`` (validated before the stream opens),
* the legacy firehose ``GET /v1/ingest/events`` is removed and now
  returns ``410 Gone`` with a migration body that names the
  replacement route — so an older SDK build hitting a new service
  fails with an actionable error instead of an empty result,
* the legacy single-shot ``POST /v1/ingest`` route is similarly
  surfaced with ``410 Gone`` + migration body,
* the per-job route is registered in OpenAPI (``openapi.json``-style
  listing) so a refactor that drops it would fail loudly,
* the legacy 410 stubs are **hidden** from OpenAPI so they aren't
  advertised as supported endpoints.

The per-job filtering semantics of the underlying ``EventBus`` are
already covered in :mod:`test_service_job_tracker` — see
``test_real_event_bus_filters_by_job_id`` and
``test_real_event_bus_firehose_subscriber_sees_everything``.

Reading a *live* SSE response with ``fastapi.TestClient`` blocks on
the server-side keepalive timer (see the 30-second
``wait_for(queue.get(), ...)`` in ``ingest_job_events``). End-to-end
streaming is exercised manually with ``curl`` against a real pod;
unit-testing it here would require an async-native client and a
non-trivial event-loop wrapper, which is out of scope for J4.
