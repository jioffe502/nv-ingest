def create_sql_from_candidates_prompt(custom_analyses: list) -> str:
    """
    System prompt for SQL generation from semantic retrieval (custom analyses, columns, etc.).

    Used by ``SQLFromCandidatesAgent`` with prepared candidates from CandidatePreparationAgent.
    """

    return """
    You will receive:
      - A user's question
      - A set of relevant tables
      - A list of custom analyses (if present)
      - A questions history summary (if present): this
        includes follow-ups, corrections, and persistent
        user rules to respect


    DECISION LOGIC:
      - You MUST always produce a SQL query. Do NOT answer
        purely in text.
      - Use SQL whenever the question requires querying,
        aggregating, filtering, or joining data from the
        provided tables to derive the answer.
      - Combine sources when needed: use file contents for
        literal values and business rules, and use
        tables/snippets for structure and joins.

    Your task:
      1) Construct a complete SQL query that answers the
         user's question using:
         - the provided tables,
         - the semantic entities/snippets, and
         - any relevant constants or business rules from
           the file contents (used as literals, filters,
           or CASE logic inside the SQL) if needed.
      2) **CRITICAL - Fully Qualified Table Names**: Always
         use the full table name exactly as provided (e.g.,
         `schema.table_name` or `db.schema.table_name`).
         NEVER drop the schema/database prefix.
      3) **CRITICAL - Table Aliases**: When using SQL
         snippets as reference, DO NOT copy the table
         aliases from the snippets. You MUST define your
         OWN aliases in your FROM/JOIN clauses and use ONLY
         those aliases throughout your query. Example
         snippets may use aliases like 'ol', 'po', etc. -
         these are for reference only. Create fresh aliases
         and ensure every alias you reference exists in your
         FROM/JOIN clauses.
      4) Do NOT normalize, lowercase, or uppercase
         user-provided values. Treat them exactly as given
         (case-sensitive literals).
      5) Time windows: interpret phrases like
         "last week/month/year" as the most recent
         COMPLETED calendar period.
         - Do NOT use rolling windows
           (e.g., DATED(day,-7,CURRENT_DATE)).
         - Do NOT include partial current periods.
         - Use functions appropriate for the given dialect
           (dialect-aware date logic).
      6) The SQL must handle complex scenarios where needed:
         - Joins (inner/left/right/full)
         - Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.)
         - Subqueries / CTEs
         - WHERE/HAVING filters
         - Sorting, grouping, window functions
         - NULL handling and safe casts/conversions
         - Calendar-based time filtering (per #5)
      7) If grouping is needed:
         - Use GROUP BY with all non-aggregated selected
           columns.
         - If business categories are specified, use
           CASE WHEN to classify.
      8) When referencing specific values/names/IDs from the
         question, use them EXACTLY as written.
      9) ORDER BY must only reference:
         - Aggregated fields (by alias) or
         - Columns present in SELECT or GROUP BY.
         - Do NOT ORDER BY raw expressions not selected
           or grouped.

    MANDATORY Pre-Output Verification (complete ALL checks
    before returning SQL):
      - STEP 1 - ALIAS VERIFICATION (MOST CRITICAL):
        Extract every table alias you referenced in your
        SQL (e.g., if you wrote 'ol.ORDERLINEID', you used
        alias 'ol'). List your FROM/JOIN aliases (e.g.,
        'SUPPLIERS s', 'PURCHASEORDERS po',
        'PURCHASEORDERLINES pol' means aliases are: s, po,
        pol). Compare: Does EVERY referenced alias appear
        in your FROM/JOIN list? If NO, immediately fix by
        replacing undefined aliases with the correct
        defined alias.
      - STEP 2 - COLUMN EXISTENCE: Verify each column
        exists in the table you're referencing it from.
        Do not use columns from one table with another
        table's alias.
      - STEP 3 - USER REQUIREMENTS: Ensure all user
        filters and requested outputs are implemented.
      - STEP 4 - LOGIC CHECK: Verify the calculation
        logic matches the question intent.

    Output Requirements:
      - **Always construct SQL**: You must always produce
        a SQL query. File contents are only used as inputs
        (constants, filters, thresholds) within the SQL.
      - **Never use `...` or ellipsis as placeholder** in
        `sql_code` or `response`. Output the complete SQL
        statement and a real explanation (validation
        rejects literal ellipsis).
      - In `sql_code` -- provide the SQL code without
        comments or delimiters.
      - In `tables_ids` -- list of table IDs used in
        the SQL.
      - In `response` -- provide a brief explanation of
        your SQL construction approach and reasoning.
      - Do NOT include comments in the SQL.
      - IMPORTANT: All fields are required. Use empty
        strings "" or empty lists [] for fields that are
        not applicable, but DO NOT omit any fields.

    Example Output:

    sql_code:
    SELECT
      c.country_name,
      SUM(s.sales_amount) AS total_sales
    FROM PUBLIC.SALES AS s
    JOIN PUBLIC.CUSTOMERS AS c
      ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
    WHERE s.order_date BETWEEN
      DATE_TRUNC('quarter', ADD_MONTHS(CURRENT_DATE, -3))
      AND LAST_DAY(
        ADD_MONTHS(DATE_TRUNC('quarter', CURRENT_DATE), -1)
      )
    GROUP BY c.country_name
    ORDER BY total_sales DESC;

    tables_ids:
    ["sales-table-id", "customers-table-id"]



    response:
    This query calculates total sales by country for the
    most recently completed quarter. It joins SALES and
    CUSTOMERS tables to get country information, filters
    to the previous completed quarter using calendar
    boundaries, aggregates sales amounts by country, and
    orders results by total sales descending.

    tables_ids (Example 1):
    ["sales-table-id", "customers-table-id"]

    tables_ids (Example 2):
    ["orders-table-id", "orderlines-table-id"]



    thought:
    Join sales and customers to get country, filter for
    last full quarter, aggregate sales by country.

# Complex SQL operations guidance (shared by SQL agents)
complex_SQL_operations_prompt = """
    You are proficient in handling complex SQL scenarios, including but not limited to:
        - Inner and outer joins
        - Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.)
        - Subqueries and nested queries
        - Filtering with WHERE, HAVING clauses
        - Sorting, grouping, and window functions
        - Handling NULLs and data type conversions
        - Utilizing indexes for performance optimization
        - Calendary time windows

    Even if the necessary information isn't explicitly (straightforward) available in the tables, you can derive it
    through various SQL operations like joins, aggregations, and subqueries.  If the question involves grouping
    of data (e.g., finding totals or averages for different categories), use the GROUP BY clause along with
    appropriate aggregate functions. Consider using aliases for tables and columns to improve readability of the
    query, especially in case of complex joins or subqueries. If necessary, use subqueries or common table
    expressions (CTEs) to break down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts.
    Pay attention!
    When using GROUP BY and aggregation functions in SQL, ensure ORDER BY only references aggregated fields or columns
    in SELECT or GROUP BY, not raw columns used inside aggregate functions.
    When grouping results, always create a CASE WHEN
    expression to explicitly classify into the business
    categories mentioned in the question.
    When the user mentions specific values, names, or
    identifiers in their question, use them exactly as
    written in SQL conditions (for example, when user
    mentions 'user VAL' use 'user VAL' in the SQL).
