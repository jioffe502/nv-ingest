_GOAL = """\
You are a retrieval agent that finds all documents related to a given query.

<Goal>
You are given a search query and a list of documents retrieved for that query. Your task is to write new \
queries and use the given search tool to find *ALL* the related and somewhat related documents to the given \
query (i.e., maximize recall).
If the user's query is a question, you should not answer the question yourself. Instead, you should find \
the related documents for the given query.
</Goal>"""

_RELEVANCE_DEFINITION = """

<RELEVANCE_DEFINITION>
- You should be careful, in the context of this task, what it means to be a "query", "document", and \
"relevant" can sometimes be very complex and might not follow the traditional definition of these terms \
in standard information retrieval.
- In standard retrieval, a query is usually a user question (like a web search query), the document is \
some sort of content that provides information (e.g., a web page), and these two are considered relevant if \
the document provides information that answers the user's query.
- However, in our setting, this could be different. Here are some examples:
    * the query is a programming problem and documents are programming language syntax references. A document \
is relevant if it contains the reference for the programming syntax used for solving the problem.
    * both query and documents are descriptions programming problems and a query and document are relevant if \
the same approach is used to solve them.
    * the query is a math problem and documents are theorems. Relevant documents (theorems) are the ones \
that are useful for solving the math problem.
    * the query and document are both math problems. A query and a document are relevant if the same theorem \
is used for solving them.
    * the query is a task description (e.g., for an API programmer) and documents are descriptions of \
available APIs. Relevant documents (e.g., APIs) are the ones needed for completing the task.
- This is not an exhaustive list. These are just some examples to show you the complexity of queries, \
documents, and the concept of relevance in this task.
- Note that even here, the relevant documents are still the ones that are useful for a user who is \
searching for the given query. But the relation is more nuanced.
- You should analyze the query and some of the available documents. And then reason about what could be a \
meaningful definition of relevance in this case, and what the user could be looking for.
- Moreover, sometimes, the query could be even a prompt that is given to a Large Language Model (LLM) and \
the user wants to find the useful documents for the LLM that help answering/solving this prompt.
</RELEVANCE_DEFINITION>"""

_WORKFLOW_TEMPLATE = """
<WORKFLOW>
- You are given a retrieval tool, powered by a dense embedding model, that takes a text query and returns \
the most similar documents.
{extended_relevance_line}\
- You can call the search tool multiple times.
- Search for related documents to the user's query from different angles.
- If needed, revise your search queries based on the documents you find in previous steps.
- Once you are confident that you have found all the related and somewhat related documents and there are \
no more related documents in the corpus, call the "final_results" tool to finish the task.
{enforce_top_k_line}\
- When calling the "final_results" tool, the list of documents must be sorted in the decreasing level of \

the second most relevant to the query, and so on.

    """Run an iterative ReAct retrieval loop per query and emit the full retrieval log.

    Each query row is processed independently by an LLM-driven ReAct loop
    (Reason + Act) that has access to three tools: ``think``, ``retrieve``,
    and ``final_results``.  The operator emits one output row per retrieved
    document per retrieval step, enabling downstream
    :class:`RRFAggregatorOperator` to fuse the ranked lists with Reciprocal
    Rank Fusion.

    The system prompt is a verbatim Python rendering of the retrieval-bench
    ``02_v1.j2`` template, including optional ``extended_relevance`` and
    ``enforce_top_k`` blocks.

    Input DataFrame schema
    ----------------------
    query_id   : str  — unique query identifier
    query_text : str  — the search query text
    (additional columns are ignored)

    Output DataFrame schema
    -----------------------
    query_id   : str  — same ``query_id`` as the input
    query_text : str  — same ``query_text`` (passed through for downstream)
    step_idx   : int  — 0 = initial seed retrieval; 1 … N = per-loop retrieve calls
    doc_id     : str  — retrieved document identifier
    text       : str  — document text
    rank       : int  — 1-indexed rank within this step (1 = most relevant)

    Parameters
    ----------
    invoke_url : str
        Full ``/v1/chat/completions`` endpoint URL.
    llm_model : str
        Model identifier forwarded to the endpoint.
    retriever_fn : Callable[[str, int], list[dict]]
        ``(query_text, top_k) → [{doc_id: str, text: str, ...}]``.
        The callable is invoked for every retrieve tool call the agent makes.
        Each returned dict must contain ``doc_id`` and ``text`` keys.
    retriever_top_k : int
        Number of documents fetched per retrieve call.  Defaults to ``500``.
    target_top_k : int
        Number of final documents to select, communicated to the LLM via the
        system prompt and ``final_results`` tool spec.  Defaults to ``10``.
    enforce_top_k : bool
        When ``True``, the system prompt instructs the LLM to select exactly
        ``target_top_k`` documents in its ``final_results`` call.
        Defaults to ``True``.
    user_msg_type : {"with_results", "simple"}
        ``"with_results"`` (default): make one upfront retrieval call with the
        original query and include those documents in the first user message,
        mirroring the retrieval-bench ``with_results`` mode.
        ``"simple"``: start the loop with just the query text.
    extended_relevance : bool
        Include the ``<RELEVANCE_DEFINITION>`` block in the system prompt for
        tasks with non-standard relevance definitions.  Defaults to ``False``.
    max_steps : int
        Maximum ReAct loop iterations per query before forced exit.
        Defaults to ``10``.
    num_concurrent : int
        Number of queries processed concurrently via ``ThreadPoolExecutor``.
        Defaults to ``8``.
    api_key : str, optional
        Literal API key **or** an ``"os.environ/VAR_NAME"`` reference.
    max_tokens : int, optional
        Upper bound on tokens in each LLM response.

    Notes
    -----
    ``retriever_fn`` must be serialisable when used with ``RayDataExecutor``.
    Prefer module-level functions or picklable callable objects over lambdas.
