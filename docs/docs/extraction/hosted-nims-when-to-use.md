# When to use NVIDIA-hosted NIMs

[NVIDIA-hosted NIMs](https://build.nvidia.com/) run inference on NVIDIA-managed infrastructure. You call models with API keys (refer to [Get your API key](ngc-api-key.md)) without operating GPU nodes yourself.

Consider hosted NIMs when:

- You want the fastest path to try models and iterate without installing drivers, containers, or the [NIM Operator](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim-operator/latest/index.html) on your own clusters.
- Latency to NVIDIA endpoints works for your region and use case.
- Your compliance and data policies allow document or query content in the hosted service (confirm with your security review).
