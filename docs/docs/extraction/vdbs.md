# Data Upload for NeMo Retriever Library

Use this documentation to learn how [NeMo Retriever Library](overview.md) handles and uploads data.

## Overview

NeMo Retriever Library supports extracting text representations of various forms of content,
and ingesting to a vector database. [LanceDB](https://lancedb.com/) is the vector database backend for storing and retrieving extracted embeddings.

The data upload task (`vdb_upload`) pulls extraction results to the Python client,
and then pushes them to LanceDB (embedded, in-process).

The vector database stores only the extracted text representations of ingested data.
It does not store the embeddings for images.

!!! tip "Storing Extracted Images"

    To persist extracted images, tables, and chart renderings to disk or object storage, use the `store` task in addition to `vdb_upload`. The `store` task supports any fsspec-compatible backend (local filesystem, S3, GCS, etc.). For details, refer to [Store Extracted Images](nemo-retriever-api-reference.md).

NeMo Retriever Library supports uploading data by using the [Ingestor.vdb_upload API](nemo-retriever-api-reference.md).
Currently, data upload is not supported through the [CLI](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Retriever/tree/main/nemo_retriever/docs/cli).



## Why LanceDB?

LanceDB is optimized for low-latency retrieval in this stack:

- **Lance columnar format** — Data is stored in Lance files, an Arrow/Parquet-style analytics layout optimized for fast local scans and indexed retrieval. This reduces serialization overhead compared with a separate database server.
- **IVF_HNSW_SQ index** — Vectors are scalar-quantized (SQ) within an IVF-HNSW index, compressing them for faster search with lower memory bandwidth cost.
- **Embedded runtime** — LanceDB runs in-process, so you do not run extra vector-database containers for the default path. Fewer moving parts to start, configure, and maintain.

This combination of file format, index strategy, and in-process runtime supports the latency characteristics described in benchmarks.



## Upload to LanceDB

LanceDB uses the `LanceDB` operator class from the client library. You can configure it via the Python API or via the test harness.

### Programmatic API (Python)

Pass `vdb_op="lancedb"` to `vdb_upload`, or construct a `LanceDB` instance and pass it as `vdb_op`:

```python
from nv_ingest_client.util.vdb.lancedb import LanceDB

vdb = LanceDB(
    uri="./lancedb_data",    # Path to LanceDB database directory
    table_name="nemo-retriever",  # Table name
    index_type="IVF_HNSW_SQ",  # Index type (default)
    hybrid=False,            # Enable hybrid search (BM25 FTS + vector)
)

# Ingest
vdb.run(results)

# Retrieve
docs = vdb.retrieval(queries, top_k=10)
```

When using the `Ingestor` with `vdb_upload`, omitting `vdb_op` in Python still selects the legacy `"milvus"` operator—use `vdb_op="lancedb"` (or a `LanceDB` instance) for LanceDB.

### Test harness configuration

In `tools/harness/test_configs.yaml`:

```yaml
active:
  vdb_backend: lancedb
  hybrid: false          # Set true to enable hybrid retrieval (FTS + vector)
```

Or via environment variables:

```bash
# Enable LanceDB hybrid search
HYBRID=true uv run python -m nv_ingest_harness.cli.run --case=e2e --dataset=bo767
```



## Hybrid search (LanceDB)

LanceDB supports **hybrid retrieval**, combining dense vector similarity with BM25 full-text search. Results are fused using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) reranking.

Hybrid search improves recall by approximately +0.5% to +3.5% over vector-only retrieval with negligible latency impact:

| Dataset            | Vector-Only Recall@5 | Hybrid Recall@5 | Delta  |
|--------------------|----------------------|-----------------|--------|
| bo767 (76K rows)   | 84.5%                | 85.0%           | +0.5%  |
| bo767 (reranked)   | 90.7%                | 91.8%           | +1.1%  |
| earnings (19K rows)| 61.5%                | 65.0%           | +3.5%  |
| earnings (reranked)| 74.5%                | 76.4%           | +1.9%  |

Hybrid search latency is typically 28–57 ms/query (vs. 31–37 ms/query for vector-only). The one-time FTS index build adds approximately 6.5 seconds for a 76K-row dataset.

Enable hybrid search by setting `hybrid=True` when creating the LanceDB operator or via the harness/config (e.g. `HYBRID=true`).



## LanceDB deployment characteristics

| Aspect              | LanceDB                                      |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Runtime model       | Embedded (in-process)                        |
| External services   | None for the vector store itself             |
| Helm / extra stack  | Not required for LanceDB (default path)      |
| Index type          | IVF_HNSW_SQ (default)                        |
| Hybrid search       | BM25 FTS + vector (RRF) when enabled         |
| Persistence         | Lance files on disk under your configured URI |



## Upload to a Custom Data Store

You can ingest to other data stores by using the `Ingestor.vdb_upload` method;
however, you must configure other data stores and connections yourself.
NeMo Retriever Library does not provide connections to other data sources.

!!! important

    NVIDIA documents and validates the first-party LanceDB operator for this library. If you integrate a different vector store, you are responsible for testing and maintaining that integration.

To implement a custom operator, follow the `VDB` abstract interface described in [Build a Custom Vector Database Operator](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Retriever/blob/main/examples/building_vdb_operator.ipynb).
