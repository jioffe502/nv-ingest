# Troubleshoot NeMo Retriever Library

Use this documentation to troubleshoot issues that arise when you use [NeMo Retriever Library](overview.md).

## Can't process long, non-language text strings

NeMo Retriever Library is designed to process language and language-length strings.
If you submit a document that contains extremely long, or non-language text strings,
such as a DNA sequence, errors or unexpected results occur.

## Can't process malformed input files

When you run a job you might see errors similar to the following:

- Failed to process the message
- Failed to extract image
- File may be malformed
- Failed to format paragraph

These errors can occur when your input file is malformed.
Verify or fix the format of your input file, and try resubmitting your job.

## Audio or video extraction reports missing media dependencies { #audio-or-video-extraction-reports-missing-media-dependencies }

When you run audio or video extraction, you might see an error similar to one
of the following:

```text
Audio extraction requires media dependencies; missing: ffmpeg.
VideoFrameActor requires media dependencies; missing: ffprobe.
```

The `ffmpeg-python` wrapper and `nemo-retriever[multimedia]` do not install the
`ffmpeg` or `ffprobe` binaries the pipeline executes.

For air-gapped or locked-down clusters, refer to [Air-gapped and disconnected deployment](deployment-options.md#air-gapped-deployment).

**Connected environments:**

On Debian or Ubuntu hosts:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends ffmpeg
```

For the bundled service container at runtime:

```bash
docker run -e INSTALL_FFMPEG=true nemo-retriever-service
```

For Helm, when package-repo egress and the image security policy allow startup install:

```yaml
service:
  installFfmpeg: true
```

This path fails with `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false` or `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`.

## Can't start new thread error

In rare cases, when you run a job you might an see an error similar to `can't start new thread`.
This error occurs when the maximum number of processes available to a single user is too low.
To resolve the issue, set or raise the maximum number of processes (`-u`) by using the [ulimit](https://ss64.com/bash/ulimit.html) command.
Before you change the `-u` setting, consider the following:

- Apply the `-u` setting directly to the user (or the environment of the pod or process) that runs your ingest service.
- For `-u` we recommend 10,000 as a baseline, but you might need to raise or lower it based on your actual usage and system configuration.

```bash
ulimit -u 10000
```



## Out-of-Memory (OOM) Error when Processing Large Datasets

When you process a very large dataset with thousands of documents, you might encounter an Out-of-Memory (OOM) error.
This happens because NeMo Retriever Library materializes extraction results in system memory (RAM) while the job runs.
If the total size of the results exceeds the available memory, the process fails.

To reduce memory pressure, try one or more of the following:

- Process documents in smaller batches instead of submitting the entire corpus in one job.
- Route outputs to a sink (for example, `.vdb_upload(...)`, `.webhook(...)`, or `.store(...)`) so results are written out instead of held in memory until the job finishes.
- In `run_mode="service"`, pass `return_results=False` to `.ingest(...)` when you do not need the full result payload returned to the client. For parameter details, refer to the [Python API guide](nemo-retriever-api-reference.md).
- Increase available host or pod memory for the ingest workload.



## Embedding service fails to start with an unsupported batch size error

On certain hardware, for example RTX 6000,
the embedding service might fail to start and you might see an error similar to the following.

```bash
ValueError: Configured max_batch_size (30) is larger than the model''s supported max_batch_size (3).
```

If you are using hardware where the embedding NIM uses the ONNX model profile,
you must set `EMBEDDER_BATCH_SIZE=3` in your environment.
You can set the variable in your .env file or directly in your environment.



## ModuleNotFoundError: No module named open_clip when using nemotron_parse { #modulenotfounderror-no-module-named-open-clip-when-using-nemotron-parse }

When you run PDF extraction with `method="nemotron_parse"`, you might see an error similar to the following:

```text
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'open_clip'
```

The Nemotron Parse NIM client requires the `open_clip` Python module, provided by `open-clip-torch`. That package is not part of the default `nemo-retriever` install or the `[local]` extra.

Install the dedicated PyPI extra before running Nemotron Parse extraction:

```bash
pip install "nemo-retriever[nemotron-parse]"
```

For local GPU inference with Nemotron Parse, combine extras:

```bash
pip install "nemo-retriever[local,nemotron-parse]"
```

Also refer to [What is NeMo Retriever Library?](overview.md) and [Pre-Requisites & Support Matrix](prerequisites-support-matrix.md#software-requirements).

## Extract method nemotron-parse doesn't support image files

Currently, extraction with Nemotron parse doesn't support image files, only scanned PDFs.
To work around this issue, convert image files to PDFs before you use `method="nemotron_parse"`.

## Nemotron Parse model and endpoint mismatch { #nemotron-parse-model-endpoint-mismatch }

When you run PDF extraction with `method="nemotron_parse"`, a mismatched model and endpoint can fail with an error similar to the following:

```text
HTTP 400: Content cannot be a plain string. The model does not support text input.
```

This can occur when you send a tagged or versioned `v1.2` model (for example `nvidia/nemotron-parse-v1.2`) to the NVIDIA-hosted Build endpoint, which expects the image-only `nvidia/nemotron-parse` contract. The library may replace the raw HTTP error with a targeted model/contract mismatch hint.

To use hosted Build, omit `nemotron_parse_model` so the library selects `nvidia/nemotron-parse` automatically, or set `nemotron_parse_model="nvidia/nemotron-parse"` explicitly. Send versioned `v1.2` models only to a compatible self-hosted chat endpoint. For more information, refer to [Nemotron Parse: hosted Build endpoint vs self-hosted NIM](prerequisites-support-matrix.md#nemotron-parse-hosted-vs-self-hosted).

## Hosted Page Elements NIM image size limits { #hosted-page-elements-nim-image-size-limits }

[NVIDIA-hosted Page Elements NIM](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemotron-page-elements-v3) endpoints on `ai.api.nvidia.com` (and the matching build.nvidia.com model experience) enforce a strict limit on **inline** image payloads. The same limit applies to hosted **Table Structure** and **Graphic Elements** object-detection NIMs because they share the same `/v1/infer` request shape.

The following table summarizes inline payload limits by deployment:

| Deployment | Inline base64 limit | Oversized images |
|------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Hosted (`build.nvidia.com`, `ai.api.nvidia.com`) | About **180,000 characters** on the base64 portion of the data URL (roughly 180 KB; build.nvidia.com validates `len(image_b64) < 180_000`) | Upload with the [NVCF Asset API](https://docs.api.nvidia.com/cloud-functions/reference/createasset), then reference `data:image/<format>;asset_id,<asset_id>` in the `url` field |
| Self-hosted NIM container | Higher; the NeMo Retriever client downscales HTTP payloads above **512,000 characters** before calling the NIM | Resize or re-encode the source image, or rely on the client downscaling |

The [Object Detection NIM API reference](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/ingestion/object-detection/latest/api-reference.html) states only that “very large images may cause processing issues.” For hosted integrations, treat **180,000 characters** as the inline cap unless NVIDIA publishes a different limit for your endpoint.

### NeMo Retriever Library pipeline users

When you route extraction to hosted Page Elements NIM URLs (for example `page_elements_invoke_url="https://ai.api.nvidia.com/v1/cv/nvidia/nemotron-page-elements-v3"`), the library:

- Renders PDF pages with default `render_mode="fit_to_model"` (targets about 1024 px on the long edge instead of full raster DPI).
- Downscales base64 page images before remote object-detection NIM HTTP calls when payloads exceed the client limit (512,000 characters for Page Elements and Table Structure).

!!! important

    The library downscales payloads to **512,000** characters before HTTP calls to object-detection NIMs. Hosted endpoints still reject inline base64 above **180,000** characters. Treat the lower hosted cap as the effective limit when `page_elements_invoke_url` points at `ai.api.nvidia.com`.

If you still receive **422** responses mentioning invalid image URLs on hosted endpoints, lower `dpi` in `ExtractParams`, keep `render_mode="fit_to_model"`, or preprocess very large standalone image inputs before ingest. For parameter details, refer to the [Python API guide](nemo-retriever-api-reference.md).

### Direct Page Elements NIM API calls (build.nvidia.com or custom clients)

When you call Page Elements NIM **directly** (build playground, curl, or a custom integration—not through the NeMo Retriever pipeline), use inline base64 only when `len(base64_image) < 180_000`. For larger PNG or JPEG inputs, upload once with the NVCF Asset API and pass an asset reference in the inference payload.

1. **Create an asset** — `POST https://api.nvcf.nvidia.com/v2/nvcf/assets` with `Authorization: Bearer $NVIDIA_API_KEY`, plus JSON `contentType` (for example `image/png`) and `description`.
2. **Upload the file** — `PUT` the image bytes to the `uploadUrl` from step 1. Set `Content-Type` to match `contentType`, and set `x-amz-meta-nvcf-asset-description` to the same description string.
3. **Infer** — `POST` to your Page Elements invoke URL with `"url": "data:image/png;asset_id,<assetId>"` inside each `input[]` item (same `type: image_url` schema as inline base64).

For the full asset workflow (including reuse across requests), refer to [NVCF assets](https://docs.nvidia.com/cloud-functions/user-guide/latest/cloud-function/assets.html) in the Cloud Functions user guide and the [Create Asset](https://docs.api.nvidia.com/cloud-functions/reference/createasset) API reference. Hosted calls require the same [`NVIDIA_API_KEY`](api-keys.md#nvidia-api-key) you use for other build.nvidia.com NIM endpoints.

For the request schema, refer to the [Object Detection NIM API reference](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/ingestion/object-detection/latest/api-reference.html).

??? example "Create an NVCF asset, upload a PNG, and call Page Elements"

    ```python
    import os
    import requests

    API_KEY = os.environ["NVIDIA_API_KEY"]
    PAGE_ELEMENTS_URL = "https://ai.api.nvidia.com/v1/cv/nvidia/nemotron-page-elements-v3"
    IMAGE_PATH = "large_page.png"

    create = requests.post(
        "https://api.nvcf.nvidia.com/v2/nvcf/assets",
        headers={
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}",
            "Accept": "application/json",
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
        json={"contentType": "image/png", "description": "page-elements-large-input"},
        timeout=60,
    )
    create.raise_for_status()
    asset = create.json()

    with open(IMAGE_PATH, "rb") as image_file:
        upload = requests.put(
            asset["uploadUrl"],
            headers={
                "Content-Type": "image/png",
                "x-amz-meta-nvcf-asset-description": "page-elements-large-input",
            },
            data=image_file,
            timeout=120,
        )
    upload.raise_for_status()

    payload = {
        "input": [{
            "type": "image_url",
            "url": f"data:image/png;asset_id,{asset['assetId']}",
        }]
    }
    response = requests.post(
        PAGE_ELEMENTS_URL,
        headers={
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}",
            "Accept": "application/json",
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
        json=payload,
        timeout=120,
    )
    response.raise_for_status()
    ```

Supported inline formats remain **PNG** and **JPEG**, encoded as `data:image/<format>;base64,<data>` or `data:image/<format>;asset_id,<uuid>`. OpenAPI specs for Page Elements v2 and v3 are linked from the [Object Detection NIM API reference](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/ingestion/object-detection/latest/api-reference.html#openapi-reference-for-page-elements).

## Too many open files error

In rare cases, when you run a job you might an see an error similar to `too many open files` or `max open file descriptor`.
This error occurs when the open file descriptor limit for your service user account is too low.
To resolve the issue, set or raise the maximum number of open file descriptors (`-n`) by using the [ulimit](https://ss64.com/bash/ulimit.html) command.
Before you change the `-n` setting, consider the following:

- Apply the `-n` setting directly to the user (or the environment of the pod or process) that runs your ingest service.
- For `-n` we recommend 10,000 as a baseline, but you might need to raise or lower it based on your actual usage and system configuration.

```bash
ulimit -n 10000
```



## Triton server INFO messages incorrectly logged as errors

Sometimes messages are incorrectly logged as errors, when they are information.
When this happens, you can ignore the errors, and treat the messages as information.
For example, you might see log messages that look similar to the following.
