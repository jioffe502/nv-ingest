# Text and layout extraction

For PDFs, NeMo Retriever Library typically uses **pdfium**-based extraction with configurable depth and paths. Scanned or mixed pages may use hybrid or OCR-oriented methods. For `extract_method` options such as `pdfium`, `pdfium_hybrid`, and `ocr`, refer to the [Python API reference](nemo-retriever-api-reference.md).
