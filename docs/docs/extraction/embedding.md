# Use Embedding with NeMo Retriever Library

NeMo Retriever Library defaults to the text-only [Nemotron 3 Embed 1B](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Nemotron-3-Embed-1B-BF16) model. The logical model ID is `nvidia/nemotron-3-embed-1b`.

For local inference, the default `vllm` backend resolves that logical ID as follows:

- On Blackwell systems where every visible CUDA device has compute capability 10.0 or later, it selects `nvidia/Nemotron-3-Embed-1B-NVFP4`.
- On older GPUs, unknown devices, or systems without visible CUDA devices, it selects `nvidia/Nemotron-3-Embed-1B-BF16`.
- When you explicitly select the `hf` backend, it selects the BF16 checkpoint because the NVFP4 checkpoint requires vLLM.

The BF16 and NVFP4 checkpoints share an embedding space. Validate retrieval quality on representative data before you change the precision used by an existing index.

The previous default, `nvidia/llama-nemotron-embed-vl-1b-v2`, does not share this embedding space. Before upgrading a persistent LanceDB index, back it up and follow [Keep the embedding model aligned](vdbs.md#lancedb-embedding-model-compatibility) to retain the old model or rebuild and re-ingest with the new default.

Helm deploys `nvcr.io/nim/nvidia/nemotron-3-embed-1b:2.2.2`. The NIM selects a supported NVFP4 or BF16 engine automatically. For NIM product details, refer to the [NeMo Retriever Text Embedding NIM documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/nemo-retriever/text-embedding/latest/overview.html).

## Example with Default Text-Based Embedding { #example-with-default-text-based-embedding }

By default, all extracted content, including tables and charts, is treated as plain text.
The following example provides a strong baseline for retrieval.

- The `embed` method is called with no arguments.

For parameter details, refer to the [Python API guide](nemo-retriever-api-reference.md) (`create_ingestor` and `.embed()`).

```python
from nemo_retriever import create_ingestor

ingestor = (
    create_ingestor(run_mode="batch")
    .files("./data/*.pdf")
    .extract()
    .embed()  # Default behavior embeds all content as text
)
results = ingestor.ingest()
```

## Text inputs that exceed the model limit { #text-input-overflow }

For text inputs, including `text_image` inputs without an image, NeMo Retriever
Library checks the complete formatted input against the embedding model's token
limit. Image inputs and `text_image` inputs with an image are outside this
text-splitting policy.
The check includes the model's document or query prefix and special tokens.
The default configured limits are 8,192 tokens for passages and 128 tokens for
queries. If the checkpoint declares a smaller supported limit, the checkpoint
limit takes precedence.

To set the passage limit in the Python API, use
`EmbedParams(runtime=ModelRuntimeParams(max_length=N))`. The limit includes the
model prefix and special tokens and cannot exceed the checkpoint's supported
limit. The same text-input policy applies to the `hf` and `vllm` backends for
both text-only and vision-language embedding models. Oversized text is split
losslessly, not truncated.

`TextChunkParams.max_tokens` controls earlier text chunking, not the final
formatted embedding-input limit. `EmbedParams.query_max_length` controls the
separate query limit.

For a registered revision-pinned model, an explicitly revision-pinned model,
or a local checkpoint, the library loads the tokenizer and prompt configuration
for that exact model version. If the text does not fit, the library splits it
into deterministic contiguous token ranges that fit. This split does not
truncate text and occurs before either local or remote embedding.
If the exact tokenizer, selected prompt prefix, or checkpoint-supported token
limit is unavailable, embedding stage setup fails before inference rather than
guessing an admission policy.

Each split row preserves the source, page, element, bounding box, and existing
document chunk metadata from its parent. The library adds one
`metadata["embedding_split"]` mapping so you can identify and order the
embedding-specific children:

- `parent_id` identifies the parent content and provenance.
- `chunk_id` identifies one deterministic child.
- `chunk_index` and `chunk_count` describe the child order.
- `start_token` and `end_token` describe the source token range.
- `content` preserves the child's exact text, including whitespace.

The returned `DataFrame` can therefore contain more rows than the embedding
stage received. Existing fields such as `chunk_index` and the physical page
number keep their original meaning.

Dense LanceDB and collection writes preserve valid split children, including
whitespace-only children, and store the complete `embedding_split` mapping in
the JSON `metadata` field. After decoding that field, use
`metadata["embedding_split"]["chunk_id"]` for the stable embedding child ID.
A collection row's top-level `chunk_id` remains a storage key derived from the
document, version, and row index; it is not the embedding child ID.

Local and remote text embedding use the same prepared rows. When this client-side
policy is active for a remote endpoint, text requests use `truncate="NONE"` so
the endpoint cannot silently replace the client decision. Image-bearing inputs
retain `truncate="END"`. For mixed `text_image` batches, the library sends
text-only and image-bearing inputs in separate requests and preserves result
order.

If a backend still rejects a prepared batch, the library reports a batch failure
rather than guessing from an HTTP status or exception that one document is
invalid. The VDB boundary refuses a mixed partial write when searchable rows
are missing embeddings.

For an unpinned custom remote model, the library does not guess its tokenizer
or input limit. Embedding stage setup fails with an actionable error. Use a
registered model, a local checkpoint, or an immutable model revision so the
library can enforce deterministic client-side admission.

The embedding stage records per-row counts in
`embedding_v1_counts_by_label`. When a batch contains an overlength or failed
row, it also logs a summary with `input_rows`, `output_rows`, `overlength`,
`split`, `split_children`, `truncated`, `failed`, `embedded`, and `unembedded`.
The deterministic split policy reports `truncated=0`.

## Example with Embedding Structured Elements as Text + Images { #example-with-embedding-structured-elements-as-text-images }

It is common to process PDFs by embedding standard text as text and visual elements such as tables and charts as images.
The following example enables the multimodal model to capture the spatial and structural information of the visual content.

- Set `embed_model_name="nvidia/llama-nemotron-embed-vl-1b-v2"` to override the text-only default with the legacy multimodal model.
- The `embed` method is configured with `embed_modality="text_image"` to embed the extracted tables and charts as images.
- This configuration is more accurate than text only, with a performance cost.

For parameter details, refer to the [Python API guide](nemo-retriever-api-reference.md) (`create_ingestor` and `.embed()`).

```python
from nemo_retriever import create_ingestor

ingestor = (
    create_ingestor(run_mode="batch")
    .files("./data/*.pdf")
    .extract()
    .embed(
        embed_model_name="nvidia/llama-nemotron-embed-vl-1b-v2",
        embed_modality="text_image",
    )
)
results = ingestor.ingest()
```


## Example with Embedding Entire PDF Pages as Images { #example-with-embedding-entire-pdf-pages-as-images }

For documents where the entire page layout is important (such as infographics, complex diagrams, or forms), 
you can configure NeMo Retriever Library to treat every page as a single image.
The following example extracts and embeds each page as an image.

- Set `embed_modality="image"` to use the rendered page image as the embedding input.
- Set `embed_granularity="page"` to create one result row for each PDF page.
- Set `embed_model_name="nvidia/llama-nemotron-embed-vl-1b-v2"` to use the legacy multimodal model.

These arguments work together. When you set both arguments, the pipeline
enables page-image rendering during extraction, creates one row for each page,
and embeds the full rendered page image. Either argument alone does not enable
the complete page-as-image workflow.

For parameter details, refer to the [Python API guide](nemo-retriever-api-reference.md) (`create_ingestor` and `.embed()`).

```python
from nemo_retriever import create_ingestor

ingestor = (
    create_ingestor(run_mode="batch")
    .files("./data/*.pdf")
    .extract()
    .embed(
        embed_model_name="nvidia/llama-nemotron-embed-vl-1b-v2",
        embed_modality="image",
        embed_granularity="page",
    )
)
results = ingestor.ingest()
```
